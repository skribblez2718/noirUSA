# noirUSA
noirUSA is a vulnerable web application requiring code analysis to discover and exploit the vulnerability. The aim is to provide a simple, yet realistic web application to practice code analysis skills on. This application is heavily based on projects done on Colt Steels's [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp) and experience with the [Advance Web Attacks and Exploitation](https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-300) course. The goal is to find and exploit the vulnerability and recover the flag.

## Setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/skribblez2718/noirUSA.git
cd noirUSA
npm install
node app.js
```

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000
